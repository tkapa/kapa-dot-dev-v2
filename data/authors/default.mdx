# Hey there, I'm Tylah - a Brisbane based Software Engineer.

I'm an absolute nerd at heart with a soft spot for rhythm games. After work you can find me reading Brandon Sanderson novels, in the gym, or hanging out with mates.

I've been programming for over half a decade now on an almost overwhelming number of projects with a broad range of technologies. In the past, I've worked on 3D and 2D games and I'm currently working for an enterprise software development company, creating websites and apps.

I'm experienced with creating websites with .NET C# and many leading JavaScript frameworks. This website itself is built in NextJs. Stick around to watch this website evolve, and if you need to contact me, you can find me on Twitter and LinkedIn!
