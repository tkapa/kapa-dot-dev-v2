Here's what I looked like while learning about how `async/await` works in .NET:

I was recently recommended this great video by Stephen Toub and Scott Hanselman, and immediately knew I would need to break blogs down into smaller parts.

# What do I think they are?
It's said in the video, but `async/await` has been around for so long that we almost take it for granted. I know that I just kind of slap it on methods and hope for the best, vaguely knowing what it does.

From my understanding `async/await` should:
- Execute delegate functions in a threadpool
- Allow for non-blocking code
- Handle errors (??? somehow)

# 5 things that I learned while watching this video
- `Action` are delegates that are already defined that are parameterless and void returning.
- .NET has 2 kinds of `Thread`:
    - Foreground threads: These are threads that keep the application alive. If the last foreground thread exits, the application exits.
    - Background threads: These are threads that do not keep the application alive. If the last foreground thread exits, the application exits.
- How does data from one thread get passed back to the continuation?
    - There's a type called `AsyncLocal<T>` that can be "passed" between threads
    - .NET uses something called the Execution Context that can take care of this for you
- How does the program know how to wait?
    - `Task`s have a load of logic behind them, more than you might think at first glance

Here's where I stopped https://youtu.be/R-z2Hv-7nxk?si=iS4aJSCt1n7Wctbt&t=2007

There's already a boatload of information here and there's been a lot of things that I didn't think about when initially coming up with how I thought that this would work. 

So far:
- Stephen implemented his own threadpool
    - Has a `static` `readonly` `BlockingCollection<Action, ExecutionContext?>` that is used to queue up work
    - Has a method to queue up work
    - Implements a constructor that starts a number of background threads to process the work
        - These threads will use the `ExecutionContext` if it is provided
    
- Stephen also began implementing his own `Task` class
    - Has private fields for if the task is completed, if it has an exception, if it has a continuation and the `ExecutionContext`.
    - Has methods `SetResult` and `SetException` which calls `Complete` and handles the result accordingly
    - Has `void ContinueWith(Action action)` which tries to invoke the continuation;
    - Has `void Wait()` which we will get to next time :)
