I found myself on a 24 hour travel stint from Home all the way to Strasbourg France. So I want to note down some of the things that I did to make the journey more bearable. While adding some things that I wish I had done, and will do on the way home.

## What I did
- **Sleep** - Time flies when you don't perceive it. I hate sleeping on flights but I managed.
    - An eye mask and ear plugs worked wonders to just block out the world.
- **Entertainment** - Prior to the flight I downloaded a series to watch. The hours tend to fly quickly when you're engrossed in a series with 1 hour long episodes.
- **Hygiene** - Nothing feels worse than feeling unclean.
    - I had a toothbrush and toothpaste in my carry on. I brushed my teeth before landing.
    - I also brought deodorant and a change of underwear and shirt for my layover.
- **Travel Comfy** - There's no point in sitting for 24 hours in stiff pants and tight shoes.
- **Stretch and Walk** - I made sure to get up and walk around every couple of hours.

## What I wish I did
- **Bring an extra pair of pants** - The change of clothes was great, but I wish I had a fresh pair of pants.
- **Pack more in the Checked Bag** - I had a bunch of room left in my checked bag. I probably didn't need both jackets in the carry on.
- **Read more** - I had a book but didn't get around to it.
- **Stay Hydrated** - It became way more obvious how thirsty I was when I landed. Find a water fountain ASAP.

Overall I did well, there were just a couple of things that stopped me from feeling 100% fresh when I landed. This is mostly for me to refer to in the future.
