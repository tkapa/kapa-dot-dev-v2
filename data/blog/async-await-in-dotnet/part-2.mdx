# 5 more things that I learned while watching this video
- `ManualResetEventSlim` is a C# class that represents a "thread synchronization event". 
- Using the `yield` keyword to return a `MyTask.Delay()` can then be "awaited"
- `MyTask` uses itself a remarkable amount in order to implement much of its functions
- `MyTask` implements `Awaiter: INotifyCompletion` which allows it to be awaited using the actual `await` keyword

- How `Wait()` is implemented
    - Checks if `_completed`
    - Creates a `ManualResetEventSlim` if not `_completed`. This can then be waited on
    - If exception is not null, will use `ExceptionDispatchInfo.Throw()` to append the error to the StackTrace

- How `Run()` is implemented
    - Creates a new `MyTask`
    - Queues the action in `MyThreadPool`
    - Executes `action()`
    - Catches exceptions if needed
    - Calls `SetResult()`

- How `WhenAll()` is implemented
    - Takes a `List<MyTask> t`
    - Creates a new `MyTask`
    - Loops through the list of tasks and adds an `Action` continuation to each task
    - Decrements a counter when a task is completed using `Interlocked.Decrement(ref _count)`
    - Calls `t.SetResult()` when `_count` is 0

- How `Delay()` is implemented
    - Creates a new `MyTask`
    - Uses a `Timer` to call `SetResult()` after a certain amount of time

# Conclusion
There's an exceptional amount of work that the `Task` class does to be generic. But it remains relatively simple at its core.

The great takeaway from this video is to know that you don't need to deep-dive on everything. But it's always great to look one level under the hood and just take a look at how the tools you use every day work.
