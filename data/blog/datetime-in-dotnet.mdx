Here's what I looked like while learning about strings in .NET:

![Mr. Increrdible going from Happy to Sad](/static/images/datetime-before-after.jpg)

# What do I think they are?
Like with strings, I can't be too sure.

I know that at its core, DateTime mostly works on some form of integer as "ticks" to determine the current time.
DateTime comparison and addition then becomes quite easy.

Though I couldn't say what the default Time Zone information is and how that gets converted.

# 5 things that I learned while looking at DateTime
- DateTime data is stored as a `ulong` but is actually treated as `bytes`
  - The first 62 Bits is the value of 100-nanosecond ticks
  - Bits 63-64 are to denote `DateTimeKind`
- C# DateTimes have a range of 01/01/0001 12:00:00 AM until 31/12/9999 11:59:59 PM
- The `DateTimeKind` Enum can be helpful for ensuring you're dealing with DateTimes Consistently

- But what are Structs actually?
- But what is Partial actually?
- Wtf is the `|` Operator?

# What were the differences?

I thought that the DateTime data was just a simple `ulong`, but it's clear that it's being used in a more complex way than I initially thought.
