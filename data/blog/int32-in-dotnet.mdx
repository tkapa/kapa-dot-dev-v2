Here's what I looked like while learning about `Int32` in .NET:

# What do I think they are?

After doing DateTime, I'm a bit more accustomed to thinking about things in bits.

I assume that an `Int32` is just a 32 Bit integer. I believe that since it is unsigned, then there must be 1 bit reserved for denoting positive or negative numbers.

Comparison should be easy, maybe the bits are assessed individually? I'm curious to know how basic math operations are performed.

# 5 things that I learned while looking at Int32
- `int` is a shortcut to `Int32`. I panicked a little bit thinking they were different for some reason.
- The `MaxValue` of an `Int32` is `2147483647` (One bit is reserved as expected).
- The `MinValue` of an `Int32` is `-2147483648`
- `{{NUMBER}}U` is shorthand for `UInt32` (kinda handy)
- I tried to look at how an `Int32` became a `string`, and my day was worse for it
  - As far as I'm concerned, the code blocks below are simply magic.
    - I was just trying to learn about `Int32` and instead I'm reading absolute atrocities and I don't like it.
- I got stunned by the existence of `*--bufferEnd` it's "decrementing the pointer operand"... We'll pretend I know what that means.
  - I tried to test this out and was blocked by being unable to write `unsafe` code. I had to add `<AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>` to the `.csproj`
  - The [`fixed`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/fixed) keyword is super interesting... and I have no clue how to use it :)
  
```csharp
    private static unsafe string UInt32ToDecStr_NoSmallNumberCheck(uint value)
    {
      int length = FormattingHelpers.CountDigits(value);
      string smallNumberCheck = string.FastAllocateString(length);
      IntPtr num;
      if (smallNumberCheck == null)
      {
        num = IntPtr.Zero;
      }
      else
      {
        fixed (char* chPtr = &smallNumberCheck.GetPinnableReference())
          num = (IntPtr) chPtr;
      }
      Number.UInt32ToDecChars<char>((char*) (num + (IntPtr) length * 2), value);
      // ISSUE: fixed variable is out of scope
      // ISSUE: __unpin statement
      __unpin(chPtr);
      return smallNumberCheck;
    }
    
    internal static unsafe TChar* UInt32ToDecChars<TChar>(TChar* bufferEnd, uint value) where TChar : unmanaged, IUtfChar<TChar>
    {
      if (value >= 10U)
      {
        while (value >= 100U)
        {
          bufferEnd -= 2;
          (uint Quotient, uint Remainder) tuple = Math.DivRem(value, 100U);
          value = tuple.Quotient;
          Number.WriteTwoDigits<TChar>(tuple.Remainder, bufferEnd);
        }
        if (value >= 10U)
        {
          bufferEnd -= 2;
          Number.WriteTwoDigits<TChar>(value, bufferEnd);
          return bufferEnd;
        }
      }
      *--bufferEnd = TChar.CastFrom(value + 48U);
      return bufferEnd;
    }
```


# What were the differences?

It seems like a lot of the basic math operations are skipped, which makes sense. The interesting parts come with conversion to `string` and formatting along with that.

All I was wanting to know was how an `int` became a `string`. Instead I opened a whole Pandora's box. I learned a whole lot... just not a lot about `Int32`.

I didn't love that I just got confused by how that conversion code worked, however I think that it brings up some things that I should explore in the future:

- Pointers + References
  - Pointer Operands
- Char
