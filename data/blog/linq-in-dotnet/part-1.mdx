I really enjoyed the last video, so predictably my reaction is the same this time around.

This one will be a part series as well, strap in for the ride!

# What do I think LINQ is?
In the same vein as Async/Await, LINQ is something that I've used a lot but couldn't really conceive of how it works. 

Ostensibly it's just a list of helper functions. Things like `First` or `Where` I'd imagine take a delegate and apply it to a list. Simple, no? I'm anticipating that I might find out that it's a bit more complicated than that.

# 5 things that I learned while watching this video

- It's still so interesting how iterators work...

That this is a valid function still kind of blows my mind... Luckily we get an explanation.

``` csharp
foreach (int i in GetNumbers())
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
static IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()
{
    yield return 1;
    yield return 2;
    yield return 3;
}
```

After compilation, we get something similar to

``` csharp
IEnumerable<int> e = GetNumbers();

using IEnumerator<int> enumerator = e.GetEnumerator();
try {
    while (enumerator.MoveNext())
    {
        int i = enumerator.Current;
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
}
finally {
    enumerator?.Dispose();
}

static IEnumerable<int> GetNumbers()
{
    yield return 1;
    yield return 2;
    yield return 3;
}
```

- So `GetNumbers()` can somehow store it's state between calls for `MoveNext()`

- `Select()` is one of the most basic APIs we use. 
    - It's quite literally a foreach loop that applies a function to each element in a list.
