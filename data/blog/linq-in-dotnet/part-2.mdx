We're back with part 2! You can find part 1 [here](/blog/linq-in-dotnet/part-1)!

I've got a long train ride, so I'm not sure where I'll stop with this one.

Here's where we left off:
- We're trying to re-implement `Select()` from scratch
- Stephen has implemented `SelectCompiler()`
- Stephen has started to implement his own `SelectManualEnumerable<TSource, TResult>` to show us how it's implemented
- Stephen also started to implement his own `Enumerator: IEnumerator<TResult>` class

Here's the video! Let's get into it.

## 5... or more things I learned watching this video
- `object Current` in `IEnumerator` has nullable reference types disabled in the .NET Source. "Oblivious" as the source puts it.
    - A great reminder that https://source.dot.net/ exists.

- `Reset()` will throw a `NotSupportedException()`. Most Enumerators in .NET will do this... pretty interesting.

- `throw e` is not the same as `throw`
    - `throw e` will change the stacktrace information!!

``` csharp
try {
    ...
}
catch (Exception e) {
    throw e;
}
```
Bad Example: `throw e` will change the stacktrace information!

``` csharp
try {
    ...
}
catch {
    throw;
}
```
Good Example: `throw` knows how to preserve the stacktrace information on its own.

- Enumerators track their state so that they know where to resume from.
    - e.g. 1 = initialise enumerator, 2 = perform `MoveNext()`

- Watching Stephen code is interesting. I've never thought about zoom level as a tool to view my progress in implementation.

- You can use `_` to separate numbers?! `10_000` is the same as `10000`. You can bet I'll probably use that for visual clarity.

## Let's leave it there for now

The end of the train ride is coming up. Let's continue on the way back.

Where we left off:
- Looking at the profiler, Stephen's implementation creates an extra object.
- Stephen refactored out the `sealed Enumerator` class and let's the `SelectManualEnumerable` be it's own `Enumerator` instead.
- However, now things are broken, an extra state needs to be accounted for.
