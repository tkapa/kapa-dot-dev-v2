Here's what I looked like while learning about strings in .NET:

## What do I think they are?
I can't lie I have no idea how Strings are stored or even compared. But maybe we can find that out.

## 5 things that I learned while looking at strings
- Vectors are an iterable list :)
- `Empty` is a constant that holds the empty string value. Determined at runtime.
- Constructors will use `FastAllocateString(length)` to assign Memory and use `Buffer.Memmove` to move the `char[]` value provided into that memory.
- Comparison `EqualsHelper`:
  - Compares the `byte[]` of both strings as a `ref`.
  - Tries to use the biggest Byte Vectors possible. Hardware must support it.
  - Inspects the 2 strings in the largest "chunks" possible, determined by biggest Byte Vector.
  - Compares the Bytes
  - Uses `goto` to keep common returns e.g. NotEqual or Equal in one place.
- I had no clue that you could use Preprocessor Directives to make optional `if/else` blocks.
- There were a lot of comments referencing "EE", which apparently means "Execution Engine".

``` csharp 
# if DEBUG
    if (isTrue){
        ...
    }
    else
# endif
    {
        ...
    }
```

## What were the differences?
There's a lot more than meets the eye when it comes to strings. They say you don't know what you don't know, and this exercise opened a can of worms when it comes to understanding .NET.
